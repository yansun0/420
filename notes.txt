scene detection:
 - displaced frame difference aka block matching
 	- http://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/blockmatching.html
	- http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee398a/handouts/lectures/EE398a_MotionEstimation_2012.pdf
	- Results: works more for clear cut scene transitions than a smooth transition over several frames
 - histagram based on colors
 - edge case: first frame might have fadein/fadeout effect from the longer cut, it shouldn't count even if it gets detected

logo detection:
 - template matching, maybe bias the weights against the center


face detection:
 - ???


 TODO:
 - (DONE) turn scene detector data into 0, 1 vector
 	- contiguous 0s = not change
  	- contiguous 1s = change occurig
  	- Use canny to map floats to binary
 - drawing the results on the image
 - setup template matching for logo
