scene detection:
 - displaced frame difference
 - (NOT VIABLE) SIFT detector
 - histagram based on colors

logo detection:
 - template matching, maybe bias the weights against the center

face detection:
 - ???

 TODO:
 - (DONE) turn scene detector data into 0, 1 vector
 	- contiguous 0s = not change
  	- contiguous 1s = change occurig
  	- Use canny to map floats to binary
 - drawing the results on the image
 - setup template matching for logo
